### Services
F5 BIG-IP monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of system performance:

1. Load Balancer
    * Description: Manages the distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers.
2. Network
    * Description: Handles network performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet loss.
3. Application
    * Description: Monitors application performance metrics like HTTP request/response time, application errors, and connection counts.
4. Security
    * Description: Manages security events including firewall events, access policy manager events, and application security manager events.
5. Global Traffic Management
    * Description: Manages global traffic metrics such as DNS query response time and DNS errors.
6. System Health
    * Description: Monitors overall system health metrics including CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk usage, and system uptime.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Load Balancer
    * Description: Manages the distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers.
2. Network Throughput
    * Description: Measures the amount of data passing through the network.
3. Network Latency
    * Description: Measures the delay in data transmission across the network.
4. Packet Loss
    * Description: Measures the percentage of packets lost during transmission.
5. HTTP Response Time
    * Description: Measures the time taken for HTTP requests to be processed.
6. App Errors
    * Description: Counts the number of errors occurring in the application.
7. Connection Counts
    * Description: Measures the number of active connections to the application.
8. Firewall Events
    * Description: Counts the number of firewall-related events.
9. APM Events
    * Description: Counts the number of Access Policy Manager events.
10. ASM Events
    * Description: Counts the number of Application Security Manager events.
11. DNS Response Time
    * Description: Measures the time taken to respond to DNS queries.
12. DNS Errors
    * Description: Counts the number of errors occurring in DNS queries.
13. CPU Pct
    * Description: Measures the percentage of CPU utilization.
14. Memory Pct
    * Description: Measures the percentage of memory utilization.
15. Disk Usage
    * Description: Measures the percentage of disk space used.
16. System Uptime
    * Description: Measures the total uptime of the system.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, the Load Balancer is dependent on Network, Application, Security, and Global Traffic Management services. Similarly, Network performance relies on System Health to ensure network components are functioning correctly.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as System Health being the foundational component that supports all other services, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
